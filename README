Hello,

This is my repository the personal projects I felt were worthy of being shared. Feel free to download and check out my work.

The following is a short description of the files contained here:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*DungeonApp*

  An interactive game played through the terminal
  In this game, you play as a hero who finds himself trapped in a dungeon. You must navigate the dungeon and fight the boss to escape
  This game was a personal exercise in object-oriented programming and scalability, and will continue to be updated as I learn more
  
  Features:
    A combat system consisting of a boss fight and 4 randomly generated monster spawns
    An item system consisting of an inventory and randomly generated item spawns, as well as equipable weapons
    Randomly generated stats for all entities, including the hero you play
    And more!
    
  Future plans:
    Port the game to Python and implement a basic visual framework - status: in progress
    Rebalance and enhance the combat system with more items and weapons
  
  To play:
    Unzip the folder and navigate to it in the terminal
    compile the classes using
      javac *.java
    type in
      java DungeonApp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*myMalloc*

  A program that simulates the memory management of Câ€™s malloc() function
  Creates an array that data can be stored in and manages the memory through a linked list that is also stored in the array
  myMalloc() returns a pointer to a location in memory where a client can store data, just like the malloc() function
  myFree() frees a pointer that has been obtained by myMalloc() and coalesces the newly freed memory space with adjacent free memory
  Serves as an exercise in low-level memory manipulation and computer architecture
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*myShell*

  A program that simulates the workings of a Unix shell script
  Parses input, creates child processes, and more!
  Includes code for piping, input/output redirection, escape sequences, and home directories
  Serves as an exercise in systems programming and operating system design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*NBody*

  A visual representation of the classic 'N' Body simulation, mimicking the gravitional attraction between a certain number of stars
  Each time the program is run, a random number of stars with random colors and random velocities are generated
  The program takes the integer argument n, where n is the number of planetary bodies you would like to simulate
  
  To use:
    compile the program using
      javac NBody.java
    run the program, ensuring you input an argument integer
      java NBody n
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 More will be added in the future as I continue to work on more projects!
